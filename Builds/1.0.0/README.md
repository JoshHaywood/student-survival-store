## Start-up guide

Download the project as a zip or clone the project from: https://github.falmouth.ac.uk/LW254830/Student-Survival-Store.

If you have downloaded the project, extract the zip folder to your files or if you have cloned the project, clone the project to your files.

Open the entire project folder in Visual Studio Code using: file open folder, then open the project where you have stored it.

Then separately in a file manager open the 'front-end' folder in the project.

Right click and choose 'Git bash here' this will open a Git bash interface.

Alternatively use the terminal in Visual Studio Code and cd into the front end folder.

In Git bash run 'npm install' and the 'npm start'

Complete this same process for the 'back-end' folder as you did the for 'front-end' folder.

You should now have two instances of Git bash running out of the 'front-end' and 'back-end' folders.

If the craco package hasnt automatically done this open a web browser.

In the web browser input the url: http://localhost:3000/

The website should appear under that URL and the start up is complete.

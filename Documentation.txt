### Targets
Decide what frameworks, package, libaries and languages to use for the application.
General organisation of the repository.
Convert existing pages into React.
Set up express for the backend.
Convert student news page to use .json.

### On-going targets
Some pages still need React conversion.
Express has been set up in basics but no page routing has been implemented.
Student news page requires that page routing be set up first.

### Issues
File naming conventions and repo organisation could create issues later on.

### Resoulutions
File names were updated and repo was organised to avoid this issue.

### Completed targets
Decided to use React and Tailwinds for the applications front end and Node.js and express for the backend.
Repository has been organsied into application, documentation and main branches, with application contained subfolder for the back and front end.

## Week 8
** Beginning 08/11/2021 **

### Targets
Convert remaining pages to React.
Create page routing system using Express.
Link .json file to student news page
Sign up and registering forms
Database setup
Animated side menu bar

### On-going targets

Only two pages need to be converted to React.
Instead of .json file database table will be used for the student news page.
Database has been intialised but has not yet been linked with the front end.
Animated side menu has been created although it isnt responsive.

### Issues
Content managing of the news page, user creditentials and subscriptions.
Transactions and payments.

### Resolutions
Content will be stored largely in SQL database with booleans to infer if the user has a subscription and what level of subscription.
Store billing info from page and use snipcart for transaction.

Page routing system was done through React rather than Express.
Sign up and registering forms have been added with correct input validation.
